# Hybrid Next for Atom

Created for those who spend a lot of time in their text editor, Hybrid Next is a dark, colorful theme for Atom that aims to be both readable and easy on the eyes.

## About

In the spirit of the original Hybrid theme for Vim, Hybrid Next is inspired by [Hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid)'s color scheme and [Oceanic Next](http://labs.voronianski.com/oceanic-next-color-scheme/)'s syntax highlighting. The goal of this venture is to create a syntax theme that is both easy on the eyes and highly readable, making it easy to distinguish important parts of the code.

This is an initial release, and [all feedback is very welcome](https://github.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax/issues).
