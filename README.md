# Hybrid Next for Atom

Created for those who spend a lot of time in their text editor, Hybrid Next is a dark, colorful theme for Atom that aims to be both readable and easy on the eyes.

## About

This project was born out of my frustration while searching for a color scheme that was both easy on the eyes and highly readable, making it easy to distinguish important parts of the code.

In the spirit of the original Hybrid theme for Vim, Hybrid Next is inspired by [Hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid)'s color scheme and [Oceanic Next](http://labs.voronianski.com/oceanic-next-color-scheme/)'s syntax highlighting (specifically for modern JavaScript), and is built on GitHub's [One Dark Syntax theme](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).

The project is currently focused on better syntax highlighting for modern JavaScript (ES2015 and beyond), though it will yield similar results to the One Dark Syntax theme it is built on and should work for any language. [All feedback](https://github.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax/issues) as well as pull requests are very welcome!
