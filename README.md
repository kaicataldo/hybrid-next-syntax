# Hybrid Next for Atom

Created for those who spend a lot of time in their text editor, Hybrid Next is a dark, colorful theme for Atom that aims to be both readable and easy on the eyes.

## About

In the spirit of the original Hybrid theme for Vim, Hybrid Next is inspired by [Hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid)'s color scheme and [Oceanic Next](http://labs.voronianski.com/oceanic-next-color-scheme/)'s syntax highlighting. The goal of this venture is to create a syntax theme that is both easy on the eyes and highly readable, making it easy to distinguish important parts of the code.

Currently, the project is focused on better syntax highlighting for JavaScript (similar to Oceanic Next), but does not have to be so limited in the future. This is an initial release, and [all feedback](https://github.com/kaicataldo/hybrid-next-syntax/issues) as well as pull-requests are very welcome!
